# Project Name

This project was to create a chatbot using mainly js and some html and css.

## The problem

I thought this project was quite complex and hard to get from time to time. I had to reset my mind many times so see the logic in this and not overthink stuff. 
IÂ´ve been using both chatGPT and Google to get the needed information. 
If I had more time I would have reviewed my code and see how I could do it better and also spend some time to understand exactly what I have achieved in this project.
